## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Disclosing details publicly before a fix is available puts users at risk.
2. Email the maintainers at [dengfengwong@gmail.com](mailto:dengfengwong@gmail.com) with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The affected versions or commit hashes.
   - Any potential impact or known exploits.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment as soon as possible.

After a fix is prepared and released, we will coordinate a disclosure timeline with you. If you would like credit for the discovery, please let us know how you would like to be recognized.

Thank you for helping keep auto-cr secure for everyone!
